In my experience, code fluency can dramatically increase the efficiency of your work and significantly add to the the amount of time you enjoy working whether it be in graduate school, as a post-doc, in government work, or really anything else. Further, coding is a versatile skill that is transferable across languages and problems. Specifically in this course you will learn: How to use R, RStudio, and the tidyverse How to write dynamic scientific documents using RMarkdown How to collaboratively code in an open and reproducible framework using Git and GitHub How to quickly and efficiently organize, clean, and visualize complex environmental datasets using tidydata principles How to pull down publicly available datasets within R (no more pointing and clicking on the interwebs) How to do basic geospatial analyses in R How to create interactive visualizations using html and JavaScript libraries Finally, you will be doing all of this work with your own data and/or data that is similar to your core datasets. Ideally, the final for this project will be an analysis that goes into your undergrad, masters, or PhD thesis. "],
["approach.html", "2 Approach 2.1 Class policies 2.2 Academic integrity 2.3 Attendance 2.4 Grading 2.5 Schedule", " 2 Approach Programming languages are just that, languages. As such, the best way to learn R or any language is to fully commit to the language and do everything you can to see it most days of the week for at least half an hour (ideally more). This can be as easy as trying to write all your homeworks for other classes in R and/or RMarkdown. Or, it can be as committed as writing everything exclusively in R: emails, your personal website, shopping lists, etc… The idea here is immersion into the language, ways of asking for help, the community, and more! I promise this immersive approach will help in the short and long run. This is primarily a coding class, and any statistical work we do will be guided by you, not me. Later if you take a stats class, hopefully the coding part will be a breeze! 2.1 Class policies 2.1.1 Inclusive classroom To encourage this embedded approach, we will have an inclusive classroom: respecting and valuing the diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and identities of individuals in the class. Students are expected to have an awareness of and sensitivity to language or actions that may be exclusionary or alienating. I am committed to fostering a collaborative and inclusive class and appreciate any feedback on how to improve my own practice. This is particularly important in a class that will have group work, peer grading, and generally serve individuals with a large range in R fluency. We all get better if we work together. Some of the best R training available comes from groups with explicit inclusivity goals, and I think that is what makes this language and community great. I encourage you to check out RLadies. A final note on treatment of others: one of the most important things when interacting with others who have more or less coding experience than you is to learn how to ask effective questions that show you understand and value other people’s time. We will learn explicitly how to do this in the R community, but it is also a good general principle to keep in mind. “What work can I do to prepare my question in a way that makes it easiest for someone to help me?” I want you to ask questions and work collaboratively and do so in a way that helps you and everyone else. 2.1.2 Flipped class Finally, the majority of the class will be “flipped,” with lectures delivered online before class and class time devoted to coding. Learning to code requires coding and we will try to spend the majority of class time doing assignments, group work, and live coding problem sets. Before class you will be expected to watch short lectures on YouTube that will be posted at least 4 days before class. These videos will generally be less than 20 minutes and geared directly towards the material we will work on in class. It is vital that you do this work before class and I will think of ways to check if needed (I hope not in a grad class). 2.1.3 Assignments All assignments will be distributed through GitHub 2.1.4 Asking for help and code on the internet: One of the most common ways people learn to code is to use the age-old (okay, maybe 10 years) technique of asking the internet for help. This is a great idea! But! When you do you should ask for help in specific ways that enable people to answer your question more easily and clearly. Great instructions are here: https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/01/how-to-ask-for-r-help.html and a more general guide to help in R is here: https://www.r-project.org/help.html. 2.1.5 Using other people’s code Inevitably, you will want to perform a task in R that someone else has already done. This is useful and part of why the R community is so great. But! If you use other people’s code, you should: explitly cite where you got the code or the inspiration for it work hard to understand the code and what it does, break it down into pieces, and try to rebuild it Code that you did not write and is not cited will be treated as academic plagiarism. Assignments will vary in how much code is allowed to be shared between students, but the general rule is that you should be submitting your own code or code from your own team. As an example of best practices, a lot of the inspiration for this page (and the class in general) comes from Mine Cetikaya-Rundel and her amazing STA 199 course at Duke 2.2 Academic integrity Academic integrity: You are responsible for adhering to all university policies on academic integrity and student conduct https://tilt.colostate.edu/integrity/knowTheCode/. TILT has a number of resources for students related to writing and study skills: https://tilt.colostate.edu/integrity/resourcesStudents/. 2.3 Attendance This class will heavily depend on you being present. There will be a participation grade that will reflect a combination of your consistent presence, focus in class, and participation in group work. 2.4 Grading Assignments Final Participation 60% 30% 10% 2.5 Schedule This schedule will likely change considerably as we move through the course, but I will keep it updated. Every Thursday there will be an assignment due the next Friday (of the following week), unless otherwise stated.

["assignments-1.html", "3 Assignments 3.1 Snow influences on summer vegetation 3.2 Snow influence on watershed discharge (using RMarkdown) 3.3 Lagos lake data 3.4 Raster data", " 3 Assignments All assignments will be described more thoroughly in class, but they are generally where you fork a repository and answer the assignment sections of Rmd files in the repo. After assignments have been turned in, the answers will be posted here as html files or links to completed Rmds. 3.1 Snow influences on summer vegetation First you will need to fork the Hayman Fire NDVI Trace repository on the csu-environmental-data-science GitHub. Then you will need to answer the questions here by using the data and code from this section. Once you have finished your assignment, you should save them, commit them to git, and then push them to GitHub on your fork. I’ll then go into your fork and grade your assignment there. This assignment is due on Monday, 9/16/2019, so you have -55 days to turn in your assignment. Negative numbers mean your assignment is late! 3.1.1 Answers The answers to assignment 1 can be found here with additional solutions provided by various class members 3.2 Snow influence on watershed discharge (using RMarkdown) For this assignment I want you to reproduce the analyses, figures, and style of this document here. You don’t have to get the table of contents exactly the same, but I encourage you to try. Here you will once again be pushing your assignment to GitHub for me to grade. This assignment is due on Friday, 9/20/2019, so you have -51 days to turn in your assignment. 3.2.1 Answers: The answer for how to exactly reproduce the html are here 3.3 Lagos lake data For this assignment (and most future ones), you will simply be answering the In-class sections of all Rmds in each forked repository. For this week those are here. 3.3.1 Answers The answers are here 3.4 Raster data Complete both in class sections of the 2 Rmds here "],
["intro-how-this-site-works.html", "4 Intro, how this site works 4.1 Why R? 4.2 Why RStudio? 4.3 Installing R and RStudio", " 4 Intro, how this site works In general, other people are both more advanced R users than myself, and they also happen to care deeply about teaching. As a result, Hadley Wickham, Garrett Grolemund, Jenny Bryan, Mara Averick, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, Robin Lovelace, and lots of others have written some truly incredible guides to using R for just about everything. Given that these extensive guides exist, are generally free to access, and are very clear, and deeply helpful, I will not be recreating any of that work here. Rather, I will organize a series of links and explainers in these sections. So this is not really a website with class notes, more just a place where helpful links and reminders will live. Under extreme duress (read: the exact tutorial I want doesn’t exist), I will post my own tutorials, this will likely happen later in the semester when we are linking together many analyses at once. 4.1 Why R? Why in this data science class are we using R instead of other languages like Python or Julia? Well, the most honest and primary reason is that is the language I have been working in for 8 years and I really like it. In addition, to my own preferences there are a few other reasons to use R: 4.1.1 The Community R has a robust and active community who are constantly building packages that extend the capacities of R, who are generally available for help if you ask in the right way, and who maintain a clear vision of the future of R. I like all these things, but the R community is amazing and different than most other programming languages, because of it’s emphasis on being kind and welcoming to new coders and to be as expansive and inclusive as possible. Because of programs like RLadies Global R already has some of the best representation of any coding language. These community aspects make learning R more approachable, fun, and open. 4.1.2 The Stats Unlike Python, R was purpose built for statistical analyses. As a result, many advanced statistics come baked into the software with a robust record of what the statistic means, who published the original idea, and links to papers that justify the approach. This makes smoothly transitioning between different statistical approaches relatively easy and well-supported. 4.1.3 The Tidyverse Many of the folks I mention above have contributed to or built packages that are part of the so-called “tidyverse.” This branch of the R world is one that advocates for tidy data, tidy code, and tidy visualization. What this means in practice is that there are a series of packages that work really well together to go from raw data, to tidy data, to clear visualizations, to clear analyses. Of course, the Tidyverse is not the only way to code in R and you should use it when/if it is useful, but I really like it and almost all of our examples in class will include Tidyverse packages. 4.1.4 Spatial R Doing spatial work in R is getting easier and easier and it is really nice to switch from statistical analyses to spatial analyses in the same environment. If your work is at all spatial, I encourage you to explore this particular branch of the R universe. 4.1.5 Lots more This list could be infinite, but the above reasons are primary. 4.2 Why RStudio? I think it is a great way to interact with R, making typical tasks like git commits, file organization, and variable verification much easier. 4.3 Installing R and RStudio Watch this video or Google it! 4.3.1 Doing stuff in R Check out: Hadley Wickham’s R for Data Science, Basics RStudio Cloud Primers, Basics Or watch this video: 4.3.2 Data in R Read: Tibbles Vectors "]
