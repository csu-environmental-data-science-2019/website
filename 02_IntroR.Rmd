# Intro, how this site works

In general, other people are both more advanced R users than myself, and they 
also happen to care deeply about teaching. As a result, Hadley Wickham, 
Garrett Grolemund, Jenny Bryan, Mara Averick, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel,
Robin Lovelace, and lots of others have written some truly incredible guides 
to using R for just about everything. Given that these extensive guides exist,
are generally free to access, and are very clear, and deeply helpful, I will not
be recreating any of that work here. Rather, I will organize a series of links
and explainers in these sections. So this is not really a website with class 
notes, more just a place where helpful links and reminders will live. Under
extreme duress (read: the exact tutorial I want doesn't exist), I will post my 
own tutorials, this will likely happen later in the semester when we are
linking together many analyses at once. 

## Why R?

Why in this data science class are we using R instead of other languages like
Python or Julia? Well, the most honest and primary reason is that is the 
language I have been working in for 8 years and I really like it. In addition,
to my own preferences there are a few other reasons to use R:

### The Community

R has a robust and active community who are constantly building packages that
extend the capacities of R, who are generally available for help if you ask in
the right way, and who maintain a clear vision of the future of R. I like all
these things, but the R community is amazing and different than most other 
programming languages, because of it's emphasis on being kind and welcoming to 
new coders and to be as [expansive and inclusive as possible](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2018/10/16/progress-on-driving-diversity-standards-in-the-r-community-an-update-on-rcdi-wg).  Because of programs like [RLadies Global](https://rladies.org/) R already has
some of the [best representation of any coding language](https://reshamas.github.io/why-women-are-flourishing-in-r-community-but-lagging-in-python/). 
These community aspects make learning R more approachable, fun, and open. 

### The Stats

Unlike Python, R was purpose built for statistical analyses. As a result, many 
advanced statistics come baked into the software with a robust record of what
the statistic means, who published the original idea, and links to papers that 
justify the approach. This makes smoothly transitioning between different 
statistical approaches relatively easy and well-supported. 

### The Tidyverse

Many of the folks I mention above have contributed to or built packages that are
part of the so-called "tidyverse." This branch of the R world is one that 
advocates for tidy data, tidy code, and tidy visualization. What this means in
practice is that there are a series of packages that work really well together
to go from raw data, to tidy data, to clear visualizations, to clear analyses. 
Of course, the Tidyverse is not the only way to code in R and you should use it
when/if it is useful, but I really like it and almost all of our examples in 
class will include Tidyverse packages. 

### Spatial R

Doing spatial work in R is getting easier and easier and it is really nice to
switch from statistical analyses to spatial analyses in the same environment.
If your work is at all spatial, I encourage you to explore this particular branch
of the R universe. 

### Lots more

This list could be infinite, but the above reasons are primary. 

## Why RStudio?

I think it is a great way to interact with R, making typical tasks like 
git commits, file organization, and variable verification much easier.
