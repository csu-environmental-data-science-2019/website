# Assignments

## 1) Snow influences on summer vegetation

First you will need to fork the Hayman Fire NDVI Trace repository on the 
csu-environmental-data-science GitHub. Then you will need to answer the questions [here](https://github.com/csu-environmental-data-science-2019/Hayman_Fire_NDVI_Trace/blob/master/assignment_1.R) by using the data and code from this section. Once
you have finished your assignment, you should save them, commit them to git, and
then push them to GitHub on your fork. I'll then go into your fork and grade 
your assignment there. 

This assignment is due on Monday, 9/16/2019, so you have 
**`r lubridate::mdy('9/16/2019') - Sys.Date()` days**
to turn in your assignment. Negative numbers mean your assignment is late!


## 2) Snow influence on watershed discharge (using RMarkdown)

For this assignment I want you to reproduce the analyses, figures, and 
style of this document [here](_book/2_ndsi_q.html). You don't have to 
get the table of contents exactly the same, but I encourage you to try. Here
you will once again be pushing your assignment to GitHub for me to grade. 

This assignment is due on Friday, 9/20/2019, so you have
**`r lubridate::mdy('9/20/2019') - Sys.Date()` days**
to turn in your assignment.
